            <h3>Categorization</h3>
            <p><strong>Primary:</strong> Deployment</p>
            <p><strong>Confidence:</strong> high</p>
            <p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> This action is primarily focused on deploying a project to GitHub Pages, which categorizes it under Deployment. It also involves authentication through SSH keys and tokens, placing it in the Authentication and Infrastructure categories as well.</p>

                <td>This option allows you to define a private SSH key to be used in conjunction with a repository deployment key to deploy using SSH. The private key should be stored in the `secrets / with` menu **as a secret**. The public should be stored in the repositories deployment keys menu and be given write access.
Alternatively you can set this field to `true` to enable SSH endpoints for deployment without configuring the ssh client. This can be useful if you&#39;ve already setup the SSH client using another package or action in a previous step.

                <td>This option defaults to the repository scoped GitHub Token.  However if you need more permissions for things such as deploying to another repository, you can add a Personal Access Token (PAT) here.  This should be stored in the `secrets / with` menu **as a secret**.
We recommend using a service account with the least permissions necessary and when generating a new PAT that you select the least permission scopes required.

            <p>&#39;GitHub Action for building and deploying Azure Container Apps&#39;

            <h3>Categorization</h3>
            <p><strong>Primary:</strong> Deployment</p>
            <p><strong>Confidence:</strong> high</p>
            <p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> The action is primarily focused on deploying applications to Azure Container Apps, which falls under the Deployment category. It also involves building the application, thus fitting into the Build category as well as Infrastructure due to its interaction with Azure services.</p>

default. Note: when using this action to update a Container App, the target port may be updated if not provided
based on changes to the ingress property.

a Container App), the Container App will be visible from the internet or a VNET, depending on the app environment
endpoint configured. If set to &quot;internal&quot;, the Container App will be visible from within the app environment only.

The &#39;resourceGroup&#39; property in the YAML file will not be used; the value for this either comes from the
&#39;resourceGroup&#39; argument provided to the action, or the default resource group name generated by the action.
Image and application source arguments (e.g., &#39;appSourcePath&#39;, &#39;imageToDeploy&#39;) will still be used to first build
and/or push an image that is used by the Container App; in this case, the provided YAML configuration file will
need to reference the image specified by &#39;imageToDeploy&#39; (or &#39;imageToBuild&#39;, depending on your scenario). When
creating a new Container App, all properties listed in the file will be set when the Container App is created.
When updating an existing Container App, only the properties listed in the file will be updated on the Container
App. For more information on the structure of this YAML configuration file, please visit

            <p><strong>Confidence:</strong> high</p>
            <p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> The action focuses on scanning code for security risks, which directly relates to the Security category. Additionally, it involves analyzing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) files, linking it to both Code quality and Infrastructure categories.</p>

                <td>The failure criteria that determines the workflow build status. You can
set a threshold for the number of critical, high, medium, and low severity
issues and use an aggregator (either `and` or `or`) to evaluate the
criteria.

To determine whether a build has failed, the threshold for each severity
is evaluated against the count of issues with that severity in the IaC
scan results and then severity level evaluations are aggregated using
`AND` or `OR` to arrive at `failure_criteria` value. You must include an
aggregator in the string. The aggregator value is case-sensitive.

For example, if you set the failure criteria to `HIGH:1,LOW:1,OPERATOR:OR`,
the workflow fails if there is 1 or more HIGH severity findings or 1 or
more LOW severity findings. If you set the failure criteria to
`HIGH:1,LOW:1,OPERATOR:AND`, the workflow fails if there is 1 or more HIGH
severity findings and 1 or more LOW severity findings.

If the `failure_criteria` evaluates to `true`, the workflow is marked as
`FAILED`. Otherwise, the workflow is marked as `SUCCESS`.</td>

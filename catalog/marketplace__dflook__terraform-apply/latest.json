If it is the exact same plan as the one attached to the PR comment, it will be applied.\nThis will be faster than generating a new plan.\n\nThere are downsides to applying a stored plan:\n\n- The plan may contain sensitive information so must be stored securely, possibly outside of GitHub.\n- It does not account for any changes that have occurred since it was generated, and may no longer be correct.\n- Plans must be generated and applied in strict order. Multiple open PRs will cause conflicts if they are applied out of order.\n- Plans are not portable between platforms.\n- Terraform and provider versions must match between the plan generation and apply.\n\nWhen `auto_approve` is set to `true`, the plan will be applied without checking if it is the same as the one attached to the PR comment.\n"

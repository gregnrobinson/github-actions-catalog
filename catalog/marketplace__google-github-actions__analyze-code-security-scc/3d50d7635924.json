You must include an\naggregator in the string. The aggregator value is case-sensitive.\n\nFor example, if you set the failure criteria to `HIGH:1,LOW:1,OPERATOR:OR`,\nthe workflow fails if there is 1 or more HIGH severity findings or 1 or\nmore LOW severity findings. If you set the failure criteria to\n`HIGH:1,LOW:1,OPERATOR:AND`, the workflow fails if there is 1 or more HIGH\nseverity findings and 1 or more LOW severity findings.\n\nIf the `failure_criteria` evaluates to `true`, the workflow is marked as\n`FAILED`.

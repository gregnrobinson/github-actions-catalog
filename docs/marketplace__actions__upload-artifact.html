            <p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> The action is primarily focused on uploading build artifacts, which is a key part of the packaging process. Additionally, it supports build workflows and can be related to managing dependencies through artifact storage.</p>

The value can range from 0 to 9: - 0: No compression - 1: Best speed - 6: Default compression (same as GNU Gzip) - 9: Best compression Higher levels will result in better compression, but will take longer to complete. For large files that are not easily compressed, a value of 0 is recommended for significantly faster uploads.

This download URL only works for requests Authenticated with GitHub. Anonymous downloads will be prompted to first login.  If an anonymous download URL is needed than a short time restricted URL can be generated using the download artifact API: https://docs.github.com/en/rest/actions/artifacts#download-an-artifact
This URL will be valid for as long as the artifact exists and the workflow run and repository exists. Once an artifact has expired this URL will no longer work. Common uses cases for such a download URL can be adding download links to artifacts in descriptions or comments on pull requests or issues.
